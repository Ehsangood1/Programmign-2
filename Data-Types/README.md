here I share what i Learnt about Data-Types and i will do a little project and Example about this part:

## Overview
In Java, data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in variables. Java is a statically typed language, meaning every variable must have a declared type.

## Categories of Data Types
Primitive Data Types
Reference Data Types

## 1. Primitive Data Types:
  Primitive types are the most basic data types built into the Java language. They are not objects, and they store their values directly in memory.
  byte (8-bit) - short (16-bit) - int (32-bit) - long (64-bit) - float (Single-precision 32-bit floating point) - double (Single-precision 64-bit floating point) - boolean (Represents one bit of information) - char ( Single    16-bit Unicode character)

## 2. Reference Data Types:
  
## Key Concepts
- List and explain key concepts or important points.

## Code Examples
- Provide brief code examples demonstrating the topic.

## Project
- Describe the small project related to this topic.
- Include instructions on how to run the project if necessary.
